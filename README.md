# Homogeneous Closest Point Algorithm Reference Implementation

2018-08-08, B. Galdrikian

## Layout

This repository contains two folders, a common source folder

./common/

and a folder containing files specific to the Homogeneous Closest Point (HCP)
algorithm

./hcp/

The file

./hcp/README.md

contains information about the files in the hcp folder.
